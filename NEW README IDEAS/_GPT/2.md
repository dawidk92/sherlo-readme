## 💡 Why Sherlo?

Building and maintaining polished React Native UIs can be tricky:

- **Visual regressions** slip in and go unnoticed.
- **Design handoffs** get lost in translation.
- **Review loops** with screenshots or screen recordings slow down your CI/CD.

Sherlo brings your components into a single collaborative space where teams can review, comment, and approve UI changes with pixel-perfect precision—before they ever hit production.

- **CI/CD Friendly**

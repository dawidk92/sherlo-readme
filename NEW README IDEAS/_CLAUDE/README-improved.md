## 🚀 Why Sherlo?

**Sherlo is the only visual testing tool built specifically for React Native developers.** While other tools focus on web browsers, Sherlo tests your components on real mobile simulators across iOS and Android devices.

### ✨ Key Benefits

📱 **Real Device Testing** - Test on actual mobile simulators, not browser approximations  
⚡ **Lightning Fast Setup** - Get started in seconds with one command  
👥 **Better Team Collaboration** - Designers and developers review changes together  
💰 **Developer-Friendly Pricing** - Affordable plans that scale with your team

<br />

## 🎯 Perfect for React Native Teams

Whether you're building the next unicorn startup or maintaining enterprise apps, Sherlo helps you:

- **Ship faster** with automated visual regression testing
- **Reduce bugs** by catching UI issues in development
- **Improve collaboration** between design and development teams
- **Scale confidently** knowing your UI looks perfect across devices

## 📚 New to Storybook?

**[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)** is a powerful tool for building UI components in isolation. It's used by 86,000+ developers and companies like Airbnb, GitHub, and Microsoft.

**Storybook + Sherlo = Perfect Match** 🤝

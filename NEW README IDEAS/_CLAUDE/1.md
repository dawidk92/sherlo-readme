## 🎯 Why Sherlo?

Building React Native apps means supporting multiple devices, screen sizes, and OS versions. One small change can break your UI in unexpected ways. **Sherlo automatically tests your components across all target devices**, catching visual regressions before they reach production.

### Benefits at a Glance:

- ✅ **Ship with confidence** — Know exactly what changed in your UI
- ⚡ **Save hours of manual testing** — Automated screenshots across devices
- 👥 **Collaborate seamlessly** — Review changes with your team in one place
- 🎨 **Maintain design consistency** — Catch even the smallest visual differences
- 📱 **True device testing** — Real iOS and Android simulators in the cloud

## ✨ Key Features

### Visual Testing

- **Automated Screenshots**: Capture your components across multiple devices and OS versions
- **Smart Comparisons**: Pixel-perfect diff detection highlights exactly what changed
- **Cross-Platform**: Test on both iOS and Android simultaneously
- **Multiple Viewports**: Ensure your app looks great on phones and tablets

### Review & Collaboration

- **Web-Based Review App**: Review changes from anywhere, no setup required
- **Team Collaboration**: Comment on changes and approve updates together
- **CI/CD Integration**: Fits seamlessly into your existing workflow
- **Pull Request Integration**: See visual changes directly in your PRs

## 🔍 What is Visual Testing?

Visual testing captures screenshots of your UI components and compares them against previous versions to detect unintended changes. Unlike traditional testing that checks functionality, visual testing ensures your app **looks** correct across all devices.

With Sherlo, this happens automatically in the cloud — no need to manually test on multiple devices or maintain device farms.

## 📚 New to Storybook?

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is the industry-standard tool for building UI components in isolation. It lets you develop, test, and document your React Native components independently from your app.

**Why Storybook + Sherlo is powerful:**

- Develop components in isolation
- Test edge cases easily
- Document component states
- Automatically visual test everything

If you're not using Storybook yet, check out [React Native Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/react-native) to get started.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Add Sherlo to your React Native Storybook project in seconds:

# Sherlo

Test your UI on iOS and Android automatically in the cloud. Built for React Native Storybook.

### Key Benefits

- **🖼️ Ensure Pixel Perfection** – Your UI, exactly as designed
- **📱 Real Mobile Testing** – Native iOS & Android testing - not web-based solutions like React Native Web
- **☁️ Visual Testing Cloud** – You build, we test - on infrastructure built specifically for mobile UI testing
- **🤝 Team-Friendly Review** – One web app for your whole team
- **✅ Ship with Confidence** – Merge with peace of mind - see exactly what changed
- **⏱️ Save Manual QA Hours** – Forget device-by-device checks - every UI update caught automatically

<br />

## Web App + Demo

Review visual changes across devices in one web app as a team - from developers to designers.

### Features

- **📸 Visual Diff Comparison** – Compare before/after screenshots with highlighted changes
- **💬 Team Feedback** – Approve or reject changes with comments
- **🔍 Code Inspector** – Inspect React Native styles directly in the browser
- **🎨 Figma Integration** – Compare UI with Figma designs side-by-side
- **…and more**
